# Assignment 3️ – Advanced Functionality

## **Due: Week 13 | Weight: 2%**

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to strengthen your programming skills by implementing advanced features and best practices.
In this assignment, you will:
- Add more complex web application features
- Integrate external APIs and services
- Apply advanced JavaScript concepts
- Demonstrate problem-solving and debugging skills

By the end, you will have a more powerful and feature-rich portfolio application that builds on Assignments 1 and 2 and showcases your ability to handle advanced functionality and integrations.
## Instructions

### 1. Repository Setup

- Create a public GitHub repository named **`id-name-assignment3`**  
  (replace `id` with your student ID and `name` with your first and last name with no space).
- Maintain a clear folder structure, meaningful commit history, and a well-written `README.md`.
- Use branches if needed.

- Organize your files in a simple structure like this:

```
id-name-assignment3/
├── README.md
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── script.js
├── assets/
│   └── images/
├── docs/
│   ├── ai-usage-report.md
│   └── technical-documentation.md
└── .gitignore
```

### 2. API Integration

Your web application must connect to at least one external API to fetch and display meaningful data related to your portfolio.

Examples include:

- Displaying your GitHub repositories
- Showing current weather information
- Fetching inspirational quotes
- Displaying images from a public image API (e.g., Unsplash or Pexels)
- Integrating a dynamic news feed

⚡ Guideline: Handle errors properly by showing a user-friendly message if the API fails.

💡 Tip: Use a simple, free API that fits your portfolio. For example, displaying your GitHub projects can make your website feel dynamic and up-to-date.
### 3. Complex Logic

Implement advanced application logic by adding features that use conditions, rules, or multiple steps. The goal is to show thoughtful programming beyond simple one-click actions.
- Create a project list that can be both filtered and sorted (for example: “Show Web Projects” and then sort them by date).
- Add a contact form with extra checks (for example: make sure fields are not empty, confirm the email looks valid, and only then allow submission).
- Show different messages or sections depending on user choices (for example: if a visitor selects “Beginner,” show beginner projects; if “Advanced,” show advanced ones).
- Add a timer or counter (for example: display how long a visitor has been on your site, or count down to an event).

⚡ Guideline: Focus on clear, step-by-step logic. Even small features can feel sophisticated when they combine multiple conditions or rules.
### 4. State Management

Manage application state so your web app updates and remembers information as users interact with it.
Examples:
- Toggle and remember light/dark mode.
- Simulate login/logout status.
- Show or hide sections with buttons.
- Store and display a visitor’s name.

⚡ Guideline: Good state management makes your app consistent and reliable. Focus on simple features that demonstrate storing and updating data correctly.

### 5. Performance

Optimize your web application for speed and efficiency so it loads quickly and runs smoothly.

- Compress or resize large images so they load faster.
- Remove unused code, files, or images that slow things down.
- Use efficient CSS and JavaScript (for example: avoid repeating the same code many times).
- Test your site with tools like Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights to check loading speed.

⚡ Guideline: Focus on easy steps that reduce load time and create a smoother experience for visitors.
